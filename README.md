## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main directories:

-   `frontend/`: Contains all the code for the user-facing part of the application.
-   `backend/`: Contains all the server-side code, including the API and database logic.

Each directory has its own `README.md` file with more specific instructions for that part of the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Node.js (LTS recommended)
-   npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running locally.

### 1. Backend Setup

The backend handles the server logic and API endpoints.

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:<PORT>` as defined in its configuration.

### 2. Frontend Setup

The frontend serves the user interface and interacts with the backend API.

1.  Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address.

## Usage

Once both the frontend and backend are running, you can access the application via your web browser. The frontend will automatically communicate with the backend API.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (if you have one) or the individual `README.md` files within the `frontend` and `backend` directories for specific guidelines.
